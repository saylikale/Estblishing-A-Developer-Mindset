		<h3>Letter to self : </h3>

        <!--paragraph 1-->
		<p>To my future self,</p>

        <!--paragraph 2-->
		<p>For now that you have started this web developement course with such a great enthusiasm I would like you to remember few things if you ever get stuck in future.It may happen that you are all stuck and you are like "Can I ever do this?". At such times , first of all change your thoughts and instead of doubting your capabilities , think about how you can come out of the problem and what skills you will have to develop to tackle these problems.Always remember that the success is all about develpoing the skills and that comes with the practice. </p>

        <!--paragraph 3-->
		<p>First of all take a short break, come back fresh and it might happen that half of your problems get solved. After that rethink on the methods you should use for given question. Again there are google, 'slack' team and many other communities who can help you solve the problem. Take their help. Ask your mentor. </p>

        <!--paragraph 4-->
		<p>You are a smart worker. You can grasp things quickly. Again your persistent nature will help you tackle the challenges you might come across.</p>

        <!--paragraph 5-->
        <p>Know that this is a 'growth mindset'.It will help you to reach your goal. It will encourage actions over rumination. It will help you learn faster and will help you to enjoy what you are up with. </p>
